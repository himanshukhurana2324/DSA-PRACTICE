This Java class `Solution` provides a method `findMin` to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array `nums`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `public int findMin(int[] nums)`: This method takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns the minimum element in the rotated sorted array.

2. The code includes two different approaches, both commented out, each with its complexity analysis:

   - **Approach 1 (Complexity O(n)):** This approach iterates through the array linearly, finding the minimum element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n) which is not optimal.

   - **Approach 2 (Complexity O(log n)):** This approach utilizes binary search to find the minimum element efficiently. It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the start and end indices of the array.

3. The binary search loop (`while (left < right)`) continues until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.

4. Inside the loop:
   - `int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;`: This line calculates the middle index of the current range.
   - Three conditions are checked based on the comparison of the middle element (`nums[mid]`) with the last element (`nums[right]`):
      - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, it means the minimum element is on the right side of `mid`, so we update `left = mid + 1`.
      - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, it means the minimum element is on the left side of `mid`, so we update `right = mid`.
      - If `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, it means we have duplicate elements, so we move the `right` pointer towards the left.

5. After the loop terminates, both `left` and `right` pointers will converge to the minimum element.

6. The method returns `nums[left]`, which represents the minimum element in the rotated sorted array.

This code efficiently finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using binary search, achieving a time complexity of O(log n).
